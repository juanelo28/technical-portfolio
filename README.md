# Research & Systems Portfolio — Alejandro Sanchez Guinea

This repository is an index of selected research systems and open-source implementations developed under my technical leadership and supervision. These works form part of the foundation for my current work as founder and Chief Scientist at **EyeTrustAI** (AI decision control under uncertainty).

## My role (across the projects above)
Across these projects, my contributions typically focused on:
- defining the system and decision architecture
- specifying representations (uncertainty, multimodal structure, neuro-symbolic components)
- shaping evaluation and validation strategy for safety-critical contexts
- supervision, research direction, and publication strategy
