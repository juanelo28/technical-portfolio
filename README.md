## Context

Over the past decade, I have led and supervised research on uncertainty-aware
AI, decision-making systems, and safety-critical machine learning across
academia and industry.

Most implementations were developed within PhD and MSc projects by the
primary developers listed below. My role focused on system architecture,
modeling choices, uncertainty representations, and validation strategies.
